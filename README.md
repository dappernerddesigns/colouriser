# Colouriser

A small app designed to be run on a tablet to create a lightbox. The app shows five colours and optional brightnesses from 20% to 200%. The intended user will place paper samples over the screen and use the colours below to ascertain flaws in the sample.

Made with vanilla js and html the project comprises mostly of event listeners to add css classes to the viewing div.
